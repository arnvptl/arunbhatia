                                <p class="text-content">Working in the government educated me – revealed an India behind the curtain – its grime, corruption and poverty. The entire three decades were a struggle to do what one was being paid for – an unequal battle against selfish and pompous bureaucrats and politicians installed  by us.</p>
                                <p class="text-content">Seven years in the United Nations, evaluating and managing development projects in various countries, were a respite for a spirit continuously at war. If this period is excluded I was gifted with 24 transfers in about as many years in service in India.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-content">But there was a good side too. The rocky journey gave us wonderful friendships that never faltered and are with us today. These would never have come our way if the conflict had been abandoned.</p>
                    <p class="text-content">The appeal for a better India will be executed by those amongst the young, sensitive to poverty, who will spend some minutes in their day in thinking and asking for reform.</p>
                    <p class="text-content">When this happens we will become the greatest of all nations. The world respects guns because there is no choice. But the same world says empty bellies with big guns don’t define a modern state.</p>

                            <p class="text-content">This bio-data is a three decade long story of attempting to enforce honesty in a corrupt third world bureaucracy. Almost from the moment of joining service (IAS) it became clear that the real enemy was the corrupt political establishment in India.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-content">I paid the price of denial of promotion, frequent transfers (26 transfers in as many years of service in India), numerous charges and enquiries, bad assessment reports, ridicule by peers, seniors and subordinates, lack of support when giant offenders like Glaxo or senior officers and politicians were prosecuted by me, ugly threats from the Bombay land mafia and so on.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-content">But there was another side also. I made friends with good people outside the system who stood by me and was able to help those being oppressed by corrupt officials. Awareness about corruption was enhanced, many were punished. Unfortunately, many were protected. When things became too hot with Chief Ministers gunning for me I managed to get a break by being selected by the United Nations for assignments.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-content">Some might say that this picture is too black. But if we agree that generally the country is corrupt and mismanaged then it won't do to say that only the IAS is honest. More accurate it is to say that the top echelons lead and facilitate the corruption.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-content">In 2004 I contested the parliamentary election as an independent candidate from Pune and received over 60,000 votes without any infrastructure or organisational support and without adequate time. This time things will be different.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-content"><strong>Honest Indians will win this country back.</strong></p>

                    <p>Soon being completed is a book on poverty, corruption and the crumbling structure of governance. And the reforms necessary to give us a better life.</p>
                    <p>It is an angry pen that strides across the pages sketching the disappearance of checks on rulers, the inaccessible courts, the dirty elections that keep good Indians away from politics, the unacknowledged but massive corruption (80 %) in the IAS (Indian Administrative Service), the cheating done by the system – in denying malnutrition child deaths, in redefining poverty to camouflage the real figures, in mocking the Right to Information Act, in refusing to introduce physical audit, in keeping institutions (Lok Pal, Commissions for Human Rights etc,) unarmed to check government malfunction etc. (The fate of more than 1000 applications under the Right to Information Act has been analysed.)</p>
                    <h3>The chapters also present:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>an evaluation of some major schemes (Employment Guarantee (EGS and MNREGA), Irrigation, Women’s Savings Groups (Bachat Gats), Resettlement of Urban Slums, Rehabilitation of Project Displaced Families);</li>
                        <li>gender issues;</li>
                        <li>corruption cases involving the IAS;</li>
                        <li>scams like the Mumbai Floor Space Index (FSI) and Urban Land Ceiling (ULC) scams;</li>
                        <li>the story of how difficult it was to punish the drug giant, Glaxo;</li>
                        <li>the Pune parliamentary election – the dirt, intimidation, absence of secrecy and the irrelevance for the poor;</li>
                        <li>the over protected, unaccountable judiciary – failing to deliver freedom and justice, stubbornly and openly refusing to clean itself;</li>
                        <li>caste, karma and the undemanding voter;</li>
                        <li>the nature and definition of poverty – reducing figures sitting in the office;</li>
                        <li>glimpses into the world of the IAS bureaucrat – training, personality, incompetence, corruption, the IAS wife;</li>
                        <li>the surrender of the IAS officer to the politician;</li>
                        <li>Nehru’s role in the growth of corruption;</li>
                        <li>Nehru’s failure in implementing land reform (to pull the small cultivator out of poverty and dependence);</li>
                        <li>Gandhi’s advocacy of caste (little known), his absurd view of the ideal state and social harmony.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>People ask what it was like to survive in a corrupt environment so, for entertainment, a few pages about myself and the family have been added.</p>
